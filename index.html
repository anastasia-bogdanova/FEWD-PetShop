        <h1>About Doggo</h1>
        <article>
            Doggo, the divine dog, had an epiphany during a walk with his owner: “Let’s open a pet store!” His owner, always understanding Doggo’s barks, agreed. Together, they launched <strong>Doggo’s Paws City store</strong>, a haven for pets and their humans. Doggo greeted every furry friend with wagging tail and kisses, while his owner made sure all pets felt like royalty. The store quickly became the town’s favorite, thanks to Doggo’s vision of joy for every pet. And so, Doggo and his owner lived happily, surrounded by wagging tails and happy purrs.
